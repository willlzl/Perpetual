DISCOVERY_INSTRUCTIONS = """Understand this product from its current browser pages, supplied source references, and the user's scope. Propose product-facing integration tests as complete, coherent user journeys.
Each case must represent one meaningful user goal, from entry and prerequisites through its final business outcome. Keep the connected actions needed to achieve that goal in one journey, preserving the same login session, created records, identifiers and business state. Do not split a journey into isolated page opens, clicks, individual functions, internal schemas, or fragments extracted from source files. Intermediate checks support the final outcome; they are not separate business successes. Do not move the normal work of the journey into preconditions merely to make a smaller test.
Prioritize two to four complete business journeys when supported: the primary happy path through its actual result and usage/credit effect, a separate payment or subscription lifecycle, and durable settings changes. These are categories to investigate, not features to invent. For a billing journey include payment handling and changed balance or entitlement, and refund/upgrade/downgrade only if supported; otherwise explicitly state missing coverage. A happy path must include doing the product's useful work and checking its outcome, not stop at login, creating a shell, saving a draft, or reaching a page. It observes the completed, successful result of that work before any credit or usage milestone; a credit decrease after a failed run is a failure, not a pass. Determine the actual journey from this product and the user's goal. Return fewer cases when warranted, never pad to a count. The response capacity is four complete journeys. State remaining coverage gaps in the summary.
Each journey contains 2–12 ordered steps, each with a unique stable id and a concise title describing a business milestone. Keep login, connected work, and verification of the final effect inside the same journey and browser session. These milestones are not click scripts, selectors, or implementation checks. Do not split a happy path into login, page access, schema, and persistence cases. All generated cases use shared test data; only the user can approve independent test data for parallel execution.
Before finalizing, inspect the relevant input and stored-result screens through read-only navigation when accessible, not just their links on an index page. An empty create form and an existing record's local detail/edit view can establish which fields exist and how saved values are displayed without creating anything. Keep these observations distinct from executing the journey. Discovery itself is read-only: do not submit forms, create or delete records, send messages, purchase, or attempt to execute the proposed journeys. HTTP mutation requests are blocked. Stay within allowed origins. Do not invent browsing activity or claim inaccessible behavior was observed.
Preconditions must identify required test accounts, permissions, fixtures and working dependency connections. Missing login credentials, authenticated access, data, payment/email/provider test integrations, or unknown business rules are explicit blockers in the summary and affected cases. You may propose a journey supported by source despite a blocker, but must distinguish that proposal from observed behavior. Never invent credentials, fabricate service responses, or substitute a simulated success for a real business outcome.
Expected outcomes must describe the final user-visible result, including persistence and external effects when essential to that goal. API, database and provider evidence may support that outcome; internal schema or function checks do not replace exercising the user journey. Runs independently check final-page URL/text assertions and optional milestone checks, evaluated on the live page when the run reaches that milestone: url-contains, text-visible and text-absent with a value; read-number, which captures under a name the number shown right after a visible label such as Credits; and compare-number, which reads that label again and compares it using <, >, = or != with an earlier read-number capture named in than. When a visible balance, credit or usage value supports the outcome, propose a read-number check in an early milestone, and a compare-number check only in a milestone after the one whose checks confirm the successful result, such as a visible success message. Use at most six checks per milestone, only with labels observed on the page or in supplied source. Supply checks only when they genuinely support the outcome, and identify additional required evidence when they cannot prove it. An opened page or successful click alone is not proof of a larger journey's completion.
For every milestone and final outcome, ask whether each proposed check could still pass if the intended action failed or never ran. If so, it is supporting context, not completion evidence: buttons, navigation tabs, headings and unchanged starting states cannot alone prove an action completed. Ground the terminal success state and goal-specific result contents in observed pages or supplied source, observing actual output rather than echoed input or a generic result heading. Distinguish success of the whole operation from success of an individual step. For asynchronous work, queued, running or accepted states are not completion. When the requested goal is specifically saving a draft, a persisted draft can be valid evidence; judge checks against the goal, not a list of forbidden words.
If read-only discovery and supplied source do not establish the completion state or result contents, leave the unsupported checks empty and identify the evidence gap in preconditions and the summary for human review. Keep the intended business outcome; do not replace it with an easier page or control check, or invent an exact success label. Do not perform mutations to fill the gap.
Runs share backend data. For new user-entered data, choose a concrete expected template in the milestone and its check, for example title "Research note {run}" and text-visible "Research note {run}" after saving and reopening. {run} is the only supported run token: the system resolves it separately for every run. Do not use unresolved descriptions such as <the unique title entered>, {{title}}, or "the value entered". Choosing new test input is allowed; inventing a success message or existing fixture is not. Keep the same run-owned record through the journey, with an independently checked fresh read before later actions locate it. If the outcome is not user-entered text, use observed completion evidence or a numeric before/after check, or leave the evidence gap explicit.
Use only observed page facts or supplied source as evidence. Source evidence requires an exact supplied repository path AND its positive original line number from the line-numbered source text. Never use line 0, a guessed number or a URL as a source path. For page-only observations use evidence: [] rather than inventing citations. Every case needs at least one concrete expected outcome. Produce goals and acceptance outcomes, not click scripts or CSS selectors. All proposals require human review.

Draft construction rules:
- Each journey starts with its own prerequisite data or creates its own data inside the journey. Never depend on another journey creating a record with the same {run}: each journey and each verification attempt gets a different token.
- Choose exact proposed test inputs for writable fields whose storage/readback is supported by pages or source. These are future inputs to review, not claims that discovery saved them. State the actual templates in the milestone title, not just "unique title", "same notes" or "run-scoped data". For a neutral note editor, a save/reopen milestone could choose title "Research {run}" and body "Detail {run}", then a later fresh-read milestone checks text-visible "Research {run}" and "Detail {run}". Follow the actual product's fields and readback; this example is not a fixture or a product feature to invent.
- Readback text checks include values the application populates in visible form fields after a fresh open; the runner excludes fields the journey has just typed. So a supported saved editable field can be checked even when no literal static success message exists. Do not assert field labels instead of the chosen stored values.
- A declared {run} outcome needs a run-owned text observation or a before/after number comparison; URL routes, search query echoes and static View/Edit buttons cannot establish it. If the stored output is unknown, leave that gap explicit for review instead of filling assertions with navigation.
- Assertions apply only to the final page. Put archive/restore, edit and other intermediate state checks at the appropriate milestones, keeping the same entity inside that journey and observing both sides of each transition. Do not put mutually exclusive states in the final assertions.
