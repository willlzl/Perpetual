# Business journeys

A business journey is a complete user flow, from entry and prerequisites to a business outcome, run in a real browser against a running application. For a Next.js app with Supabase and Stripe, one journey might sign in, choose a plan, pay in Stripe test mode, return to the app and check that the account shows the new plan. Beta and Gamma (Sandbox) stages hold a stage's journeys.

The controller owns every verdict. A successful click, finished code or a recording is never a pass on its own, and an application environment that is Ready says nothing about whether a journey passes.

Each journey has a reviewed goal, preconditions, ordered business milestones, fixed expected outcomes and independent checks. Every run executes the journey's Playwright code in a dedicated local Chromium, with no model:

- A **browser agent** (Browser Use) explores the application and drafts journeys. It never acts in a run.
- An **agent writes the code**: Playwright's generator agent turns a reviewed journey into Playwright actions. The code holds no checks; the reviewed checks come from the journey at run time.
- **A person approves the code** after its verification: three passing runs, then a control run with every write blocked in which a reviewed outcome check must fail after a fresh page read. See [Journey code](#journey-code).

The design is recorded in [Browser-first business testing](architecture/browser-first.md), [Journey contract](architecture/journey-contract.md), [Playwright journeys](architecture/playwright-journeys.md) and [ADR 0001](adr/0001-gate-runs-approved-playwright-code.md).

## Install

Use Node 24.12 or later and [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/), which supplies Python 3.11–3.13. Runs need Playwright's Chromium; discovery needs the browser agent's own runtime, which shares that Chromium because both Playwright packages pin the same version. `npm run setup` installs both:

```sh
npx playwright install chromium
uv sync --project integrations/browser-use --frozen
```

Linux hosts may also need Chromium's system libraries (`npx playwright install-deps chromium`). `PERPETUAL_BROWSER_PYTHON` can name an absolute Python executable that has the pinned browser dependencies. Code generation runs a pinned OpenCode release through `npx`, which setup fetches and which otherwise downloads on first use. Do not use a personal browser profile or production login state.

## Configure a model

Discovery, drafting and code generation use a model; runs do not. Open the app-wide **Settings** page from the sidebar. Enter an **OpenRouter API Key** and choose a model; the list comes from OpenRouter's catalog of models that take text and images and support tools, and the saved model, else `openai/gpt-5.4-mini`, is preselected when the catalog has it. Or export the settings before starting the controller:

```sh
export OPENROUTER_API_KEY='your-key'
export PERPETUAL_MODEL='openai/gpt-5.4-mini'                   # optional
export PERPETUAL_MODEL_BASE_URL='https://openrouter.ai/api/v1'  # optional
node src/cli.ts serve --repo /absolute/path/to/your/repo
```

`PERPETUAL_MODEL_API_KEY` with `PERPETUAL_MODEL` and `PERPETUAL_MODEL_BASE_URL` selects another OpenAI-compatible endpoint for discovery. Saved settings take precedence over the environment. They are stored in the controller's data directory with mode 0600, and no response returns the key.

The model receives the task, bounded source excerpts, requirements and observed page content. Drafting a journey from a description, dictation and code generation need an OpenRouter key and model in Settings, and use OpenRouter credits. Writing code needs a more capable model than exploring; a small model can fail to write valid code.

## Where journeys run

A stage's journeys run against one application URL, set beside the stage's application link.

| Situation | What is needed |
| --- | --- |
| An existing preview or Beta URL | The test browser only |
| An application already running on localhost | The test browser only |
| Source exists but the app is not running | A [twin](twins.md) of the stage, or the app and its dependencies started some other way |
| An independent, resettable database is needed | A twin, which starts its services from scratch |

Code generation works against the selected application URL, including an existing application without a twin. When that URL belongs to a managed twin, it must be this stage's ready twin and is reserved for the generation. A twin's data persists between runs until the twin is rebuilt; the [journey gate](gate.md) rebuilds it for every commit it tests.

When a new twin is Ready and a person has not chosen another URL, the target becomes the twin's one web-frontend app, or else its only app; otherwise a person chooses. A newly ready twin also prepares journey drafts once, when a model, the browser runtime and an unambiguous URL are available and the stage has no tests yet. Missing setup stays visible without failing the twin. Opening a page or restarting the controller never starts this paid discovery again. A twin that becomes ready while its stage runs journeys or saves model settings takes over the stage's automatic URL at once, and during a verification once the verification ends; it is prepared once the stage is idle, without spending its one attempt on the busy stage. A restart drops such a deferred preparation.

For an existing URL, discovery, generation, verification and runs reserve its origin across stages; loopback aliases share that reservation. Verification keeps it between attempts. An interrupted operation or unconfirmed browser cleanup keeps a durable hold across controller restarts and preserves a generation's workspace. There is currently no UI/API for confirming cleanup of an external browser; operator recovery is required before reusing that origin. A restart alone does not clear the hold.

A fresh browser context resets cookies and storage, not database rows or external service state. Browser navigation is limited to the application's origins plus, for runs, the stage's reviewed external origins; that is not network isolation, and application assets and API requests can still reach the application's configured dependencies.

## Workflow

1. Open **Integration tests** on a Beta or Gamma stage and set the application URL.
2. Choose **Generate** to explore the application, optionally with a test focus. The agent receives bounded, redacted source context sampled across UI, API, product documentation and shared code, and proposes up to four journeys as unselected drafts. Generate can replace the current tests after a successful, nonempty discovery; a failed or empty replacement keeps them. To add one journey instead, choose **Add test**, enter its **Description** (typed, or dictated with **Dictate**) and choose **Generate test**. This turns the description and source context into one draft without opening the application.
3. Review the draft's goal, preconditions, milestones, checks and expected outcomes, then save. Completing review requires at least one independent milestone check or final assertion; a journey without one stays a draft marked **Needs checks**. Add missing account or fixture requirements. Cases need no CSS selectors or authored click steps.
4. From the reviewed journey's actions menu choose **Generate code**. The generator writes the journey's actions as a draft. **Generate code** and **Verify code** offer the same test-account choice as a run. **Verify code** runs the draft three times and then once with every change blocked; **Approve code** shows the draft, or its diff against the approved code, and approves exactly that code. **Discard draft** drops it.
5. Select reviewed journeys and run them. The run dialog's **Test account** offers the twin's test accounts (the first by default), a manually entered account, or none; without twin accounts, **Use test account** takes a manually entered one. Entered values stay in the dialog for one request. Each journey runs its approved code or, in a person's run, its current draft when no approved code is current; the gate runs approved code only. Running needs Playwright's Chromium and code for every chosen journey, not a model. Closing the live viewer does not cancel the run; **Stop** does.
6. Read the result. The reviewed checks run inside each journey; a journey with no check or final assertion stays **Needs review**.

Running one unselected journey temporarily selects it. Its panel restores that choice after the stage is idle; a failed save keeps the restoration pending and offers **Restore selection**, without running the journey again. The tab remembers only the repository, stage and case IDs across a reload, and resumes restoration when the panel opens. This is tab-owned recovery, not controller-owned state: restore or deselect the journey before closing the tab. Later saved selection changes take precedence.

**Add test** appears only on Sandbox stages. A stage holds at most 60 cases; a run takes 1 to 30 of them.

Description-based drafting keeps the existing 4,096-token output cap for models with lower output limits. It requests low reasoning effort only when the cached OpenRouter catalog lists that capability; otherwise it retains the provider default. This is an effort request, not a guaranteed token reservation. Reasoning text is excluded from the response, but still counts against the output limit ([reasoning tokens](https://openrouter.ai/docs/guides/best-practices/reasoning-tokens)). A response cut off by that limit is refused with an output-limit error, even if its JSON parses. A complete standalone JSON Markdown block is unwrapped before the same case validation; prose, multiple proposals and partial output are refused. There is no automatic paid retry, and the dialog keeps the description for an explicit retry or edit.

**Dictate** records a description after microphone permission. **Stop** sends the recording through the local controller to OpenRouter's transcription endpoint and appends the transcript to the editable description. Audio is not written to application storage. Recording stops automatically at two minutes and is capped at 8 MiB; closing the dialog discards an unfinished recording and cancels a pending transcription. Typing stays available when the browser cannot use a microphone.

## Cases and milestones

A reviewed case has a name, goal, preconditions, expected outcomes, final assertions, `isolation` (`shared` by default, or `isolated`) and ordered milestones, `steps: [{id, title, checks?}]`. A case saved as reviewed needs 2 to 12 milestones and at least one milestone check or final assertion, unless it is identical to a stored case from before milestones (selecting or deselecting it is allowed). Generated and drafted cases always stay drafts until a person saves a review; generation never approves or runs them.

A milestone may carry up to 6 checks, which the fixture evaluates on the live page after the milestone's actions, each waiting up to 10 seconds for its condition:

- `url-contains`, `text-visible` or `text-absent`, with a `value`;
- `read-number` with a `label` and a `name`: captures the number shown after the visible label;
- `compare-number` with `label`, `name`, `op` (`<`, `>`, `=` or `!=`) and `than`, the name of a `read-number` from an earlier milestone or earlier in the same one.

A text check's value or a number check's label may name the run's token as `{run}`; see [Run-unique values](#run-unique-values).

`text-visible` also passes when a visible text field, text area or select holds the text as the application put it there, matched as visible text is (ignoring case and runs of whitespace), so a saved value shown in an editable field can be checked; `text-absent` passes exactly when `text-visible` would fail. A password field is never read, nor a field the journey edited on the current page, nor any field of a page the browser returned to through history, which restores what was typed before. A journey's own typing therefore never passes its check: reloading or reopening the page shows what was kept.

Final assertions (`url-contains`, `text-visible`, `text-absent`) describe the page the journey ends on. These checks observe page text, form fields the application filled, URLs and numbers; they do not independently prove database persistence, payment settlement or email delivery.

## Discovery

Discovery explores the target read-only: the browser blocks mutating HTTP requests. With a test account, discovery may also sign in, and may POST to up to three configured auth endpoints on the application host, each with a path other than `/`; a twin's test account supplies its own sign-in endpoint. If neither the configuration nor the selected twin account supplies an endpoint, discovery refuses before starting a browser or model and asks for a **Sign-in API endpoint** in **Test settings**. An entered account never borrows another account's endpoints, and a sign-in page does not authorize POSTs. The result records whether it signed in, and where its account signed in becomes the stage's [sign-in page](#test-accounts) while the stage has none. Without an account, authenticated screens can stay unexplored; such gaps become preconditions, not invented coverage. The stage's `maxSteps` (1 to 100, default 60) bounds the agent's actions.

Applications that read through POST may configure **Read-only POST requests** in **Test settings**. A person reviews each application URL and its complete fixed JSON body before saving it. Discovery and the verification control admit only a POST with that exact URL and raw body, JSON content type and no method override; other requests to the same endpoint remain blocked, and reviewed POST reads never follow redirects. A redirect produces a failed read; configure the canonical endpoint instead. Requests must stay on the application origin, without query strings, URL credentials or fragments, and contain no secrets. The limit is 10 requests with bodies of at most 4096 UTF-8 bytes each. Changed variables, whitespace, batches or dynamically constructed bodies need their own review; Perpetual infers no permission from an endpoint or a GraphQL operation name. This permits bounded reads, not arbitrary GraphQL/RPC access; see [ADR 0003](adr/0003-review-fixed-post-reads.md).

Discovery retains at most 10 distinct blocked method and origin/path pairs, centrally redacted before clipping each URL to 512 characters. It records no request body, header, query value, fragment or URL credentials. Failed discovery exposes that evidence with its actionable error; successful discovery adds it to its bounded summary so a missing read can be configured without paid trial-and-error retries. Opening or saving settings never starts discovery.

Source evidence is limited to supplied repository paths and line numbers; a citation of a line that was not supplied is dropped. A journey that is invalid for another reason is left out and named, with its reason, at the end of the discovery summary (at most 4000 characters). Discovery fails when it accepts no journey and either proposed one or was replacing tests; existing tests are kept.

Discovery and description-based drafting ask whether each proposed check would still pass if the intended action failed or never ran. Completion checks should observe the relevant operation's successful terminal state and the requested result contents, grounded in accessible pages or source. A run button or summary tab alone cannot prove a finished report. Saving a draft may legitimately verify a persisted draft when that is the requested goal. When completion evidence is unavailable, the model is instructed to leave those checks empty and name the gap for review, preserving the business outcome.

These instructions guide proposals; the case validator checks structure, not business meaning. Review must establish that the checks prove the intended outcome. The write-blocked control run requires at least one eligible reviewed outcome check to detect blocked changes after a fresh page read; it does not prove every later milestone has adequate checks.

Source and page text are untrusted content: they cannot authorize tools or change expected outcomes. Discovery is not recorded.

## Runs

- **Code.** Each journey runs as one `playwright test` process. A journey without code needs review with *Generate and approve code for this journey.*, one whose approved code is stale with *The approved code is for an earlier version of this journey.*, and one whose stored code the current grammar rejects with *Generate code for this journey again: …*. These, and code that signs in with no account available (blocked), are settled without a browser while the run's other journeys still run.
- **Concurrency.** A run takes `concurrency` 1 to 4 (default 2). Each journey has its own browser, session, frames and progress. Journeys with shared test data run one at a time; only journeys a person marked `isolated` can overlap. A single test account forces serial scheduling. A fresh browser profile does not isolate balances, subscriptions or other backend state.
- **Time.** `journeyTimeoutSeconds` is 60 to 1800 (default 900) per journey. There are no automatic retries: the generated Playwright config sets `retries: 0` and `failOnFlakyTests: true`.
- **Origins.** Runs may also open up to 10 reviewed `externalOrigins`: HTTPS origins with no path, query or credentials, such as a Stripe checkout. Every document request, redirect hops included, is checked against the allowed origins. A top-level Stripe page loads only when its path shows test mode (`cs_test_` or `/test_`, never `cs_live_` or `/live_`), and nothing live from Stripe loads in any frame. A refused top-level navigation, or a page no check can judge, stops the journey for review, never as a failed check.
- **Blocked services.** When a twin service is blocked for missing inputs, the code still runs. Missing inputs stay visible on the environment; they do not establish which dependency a journey used or why it stopped. The journey keeps its own checks, errors and explicit prerequisite blockers. An unrelated service never turns a failure or incomplete journey into a different verdict.
- **Skip and stop.** A queued journey can be skipped without launching, and one skipped before its run settles the journeys without code stays skipped. An active journey becomes `skipping` until its browser has cleaned up, then `skipped`; other journeys keep their results. Skipping cannot undo actions already performed. **Stop** cancels the whole run. Uncertain browser cleanup quarantines the twin.
- **Restart.** After a controller restart, journeys that never started become `cancelled`, running ones `failed`, and skipping ones `skipped`; a milestone still `running` becomes `unconfirmed`. A verification's interrupted attempt ends `cancelled`, and so does its verification.

Drafts and case saves can happen during a run, because a run uses its own snapshot of the reviewed cases; they cannot overlap discovery or another case write. Each run keeps that snapshot and names the code each journey ran, so historical results stay tied to the exact reviewed case and code.

### Test accounts

Runs, discovery, code generation and verification accept either a request-only `credentials` account or a twin `accountId`, not both. Without either, a ready twin's first test account signs in; `accountId: null` uses none. Account values reach only the current browser process and are never saved with cases, configuration, code or run requests. The controller reads a twin account's password from the twin's private state; views list only its id, label and username.

A run's code signs in with `journey.signIn()`, which fills the account into the page's one visible sign-in form; a sign-up form, whose password is marked `new-password` or asked for twice, is not one. The application URL may be a landing page without that form, so a stage can name a **sign-in page** beside its application URL: when the current page shows no sign-in form within 2 seconds, `signIn()` opens the sign-in page and signs in there. Without a sign-in page it waits the action timeout, as a slowly rendered form needs, then stops the milestone with *The application URL shows no sign-in form. Set the sign-in page.*; a sign-in page that shows no form stops it with *The sign-in page shows no sign-in form. Check the sign-in page.* The account is entered only on the application URL's origin. The fixture takes the account, the sign-in page and the run's token out of the process environment before any code runs, so neither the code nor the browser it drives can read them.

The sign-in page is an http(s) URL on the application URL's origin, without credentials, of at most 2048 characters. It keeps its hash, since a hash-routed application shows its form only on its route, such as `#/login`. A save whose sign-in page is not on the application URL's origin is refused, so moving the application URL to another origin means moving or clearing the sign-in page too. When a new twin moves the automatic application URL to another origin, as a changed port does, the sign-in page moves with it, keeping its path, query and hash; a twin with no single application URL clears both, and the path waits for the next twin. Discovery records only the path of the page where its account signed in, on the application URL's origin: a page with a hash is ignored, and a path segment's `;` parameters, such as `;jsessionid=`, are dropped, since they can carry tokens. Discovery never replaces a person's sign-in page.

In discovery, the worker gives Browser Use placeholders instead of the values. Before substituting them it checks the exact scheme, host, port, top-level frame and input type, and a password goes only into a password field. With an account, the agent can also call `sign_in_with_test_account`, which fills the page's one visible sign-in form, submits it and reports `signed_in`, `still_on_sign_in`, `no_sign_in_form` or `error`, never a value. Account-backed discovery sends the model page text without screenshots, with the account values redacted. Cross-origin and iframe sign-in are not supported.

Twin test accounts are generated local test data, so evidence, results, live frames and recordings show what the run observed about them. Model API keys and `Bearer` tokens are scrubbed from free text. Use dedicated test accounts, never production ones.

## Journey code

Journey code is the Playwright actions of one reviewed journey, saved as stage data. A journey has at most one **approved** code and one **draft** beside it. Generated or saved code is always the draft and never replaces the approved code by itself. Editing the goal, preconditions, milestones, checks, expected outcomes or final assertions makes both stale; renaming or selecting does not. Stale approved code whose actions still fit the edited journey's milestones can be taken as its draft again with **Reuse approved code**, to verify and approve like any draft, so an edit to a check needs no model. Removing a case removes its code. Code references call it the journey's spec.

Changing the reviewed POST-read requests makes old verification evidence inapplicable and approved code **Stale**. Reuse the code as a draft, verify and approve it again; this needs no model. Reordering unchanged rules preserves their policy identity. When a managed twin rebuilds the same identified application service on a different host alias or port, its fixed paths and bodies follow that service and preserve policy identity; every worker still receives exact URLs for the current origin. An ambiguous target suspends these rules, and another application service never inherits them. An explicitly changed application origin uses a different policy identity and requires verification again. Stages without these rules retain their original version 3 evidence.

### Grammar

Code runs in the same process as the fixture that judges it, so `src/journeys/playwright/specs.ts` accepts a grammar rather than arbitrary JavaScript. Code is at most 200 KB, parsed by Playwright's bundled Babel, and has exactly `import { test } from 'perpetual'` and one plain `test(title, async ({ page, journey }) => { … })`, never `test.skip`, `test.fixme`, `test.only` or another modifier. Its body only awaits `journey.milestone('<id>', async () => { … })`, with literal IDs for exactly the case's milestones, in order. A milestone only awaits `journey.signIn()` or one Playwright action on `page`, its locators and frame locators, `page.keyboard` or `page.mouse` (`goto` to an http(s) URL or path, `reload`, `click`, `fill`, `press`, `selectOption`, `waitForURL`, …), with literal, options-object or locator arguments. The one value an argument may read is the run's token, `journey.run`, alone or in a template literal such as `` `QA ${journey.run}` ``, and `goto` still takes only a literal address. The text of a typing action (`fill`, `type` or `pressSequentially` on a locator, `keyboard.type` or `keyboard.insertText`) may hold it in any milestone. Anywhere else, such as a locator's name, a filter or `waitForURL`, it may name an element or address only in a milestone after one with a check that fails when this run's data is missing: a `text-visible`, `read-number` or `compare-number` check whose text reads `{run}`. Before such a check, a control run's blocked save would make the action looking for the data fail, which catches nothing, so the draft could never be verified. A `text-absent` check passes with nothing saved and an address can carry typed text without a save, so neither unlocks it. No other identifier, declaration, assignment, computed access, function or control flow is accepted, so `expect`, page scripts, routing, direct requests, `process` and other globals cannot be written. Milestone IDs are judged in order before a milestone's actions. A run validates the stored code again, so an approval kept from an older grammar never runs.

### Run-unique values

A fresh browser session does not reset the twin's data, so a journey that saves a fixed value and later checks it passes once any earlier run stored it: its control run passes with nothing saved (`missed`), and so does a later gate run of a broken save. Each journey process therefore gets a token, 8 random lowercase letters or digits, new for every run and every verification attempt. Code reads it only as `journey.run`, and a reviewed check names it as `{run}`: before judging the page, the fixture replaces every `{run}` in a text check's value, in milestone checks and final assertions, or in a number check's label with the token. Code types data a later check reads with the token (`` `QA ${journey.run}` ``), and the check reads `QA {run}`, so a control run looks for a value no run stored.

The token only fills in the reviewed text: it never changes which check runs, and code cannot change it. Results keep each check as written with `resolved`, the text it looked for, and milestone evidence shows both, such as `Text visible “QA {run}” (“QA k3m9x2qa”)`. The review interface shows checks as written.

### Check version

The check version is 3 (`CHECK_VERSION` in `src/journeys/playwright/checks.ts`): a caught control requires a failed eligible outcome check after a successful fresh page read. Version 1 read visible text only; version 2 also read values the application put in form fields. Each verification and approval records its version.

An approval under an older version is **Stale** and cannot authorize a gate run. Its code, approval and history are preserved. Choose **Reuse approved code**, then **Verify code** and **Approve code** to use it under the current version; reuse needs no model. Drafts verified under an older version also need verification again. Loading saved state or restarting the controller never starts generation or verification.

### Verification

A draft must pass its verification before it can be approved. **Verify code** runs, one after another, up to four ordinary runs of exactly that draft for its one journey, selected or not, with a person's account rules:

1. Attempts 1 to 3 must pass; the verification stops at the first that does not, with that journey's error.
2. Attempt 4 is the **control run**. Every request whose method is not GET, HEAD or OPTIONS, on every origin and form submissions included, is answered without being sent, except an exact reviewed POST read or while `journey.signIn()` runs: a form submission gets 204, which leaves its page as it was, and any other request 503. Once the journey acts on a page after one of its WebSockets opened, by clicking, typing, pressing a key or selecting, that socket drops what the page sends, except while `journey.signIn()` runs. Until then, a socket's opening messages and subscriptions still reach the application, and messages from the server always arrive.

The control is **caught** only when a reviewed outcome check fails after a blocked request or socket send and a successful fresh top-level GET of the page being judged. A later blocked request, failed read or unguarded write invalidates that evidence. The eligible failure is a text check whose value holds `{run}`, or a `compare-number` check that read a finite number and compares it with a baseline captured before the blocked change. A missing number, a static “Saved” acknowledgement or a URL check alone cannot qualify. The fixture reports this fact as `controlRead`; the controller also requires the actual failed reviewed check.

A control without that evidence is **missed** and verification fails, even when its journey has a failed check. A blocked action or another incomplete result cannot authorize approval either. Reload or reopen the relevant page before the outcome milestone's checks so they can observe what the application kept.

Unreviewed POST reads (GraphQL, RPC) remain blocked, as do socket reads after the journey acts on their page. A failed check caused by that unreadable state does not count as caught, and approval is refused. An allowed POST read does not replace the required fresh top-level GET or prove a business outcome by itself. Heartbeats are dropped the same way, so a server that closes silent sockets may close one during a longer control run.

Playwright cannot route a worker's WebSocket, a page's WebSocketStream or anything a shared worker sends, and a socket that opens after the journey acted sends freely until the journey acts again, so it may carry a write. A message sent outside the guard or a shared worker invalidates control evidence, even when a reviewed check fails. Code for a journey whose application keeps its changes only that way cannot be verified.

A verification holds only for the draft's code, the reviewed journey it ran against, the reviewed POST-read policy and the current [check version](#check-version): the same code saved again for changed checks is unverified, and an attempt that could not run that draft, because its journey changed meanwhile, fails the verification. One verification runs per stage. While it runs, it holds its stage, so a gate waits, and a person's run, discovery, code generation in the stage, saving model settings and saving, approving or discarding that journey's code are refused; an attempt waits while a person's test save holds the stage instead of failing on it. It holds its twin from its start to its end, so a health check or another operation never takes the twin between attempts, and every attempt runs with the test settings and on the twin the verification started with: when that twin is gone or no longer ready, the verification fails with *The environment changed during its verification. Verify its code again.* **Stop verifying** cancels it; a controller restart ends an unfinished one as cancelled.

The draft keeps its latest verification's record, written as it starts, after each attempt and at its end, a stopping controller included, so neither a restart nor a run history that no longer holds its attempts loses its verdict or brings back an older verification's. The run history keeps the controller's latest 50 runs across all stages, and every attempt of a verification still running. A verification that an older controller left without a record is judged from its attempts, and once one of them is no longer kept, it verified nothing and must run again. Control runs never count as a journey's current status and show `Control` in the Runs list and the run viewer; verification runs never reach the gate.

### Approval

**Approve code** opens a dialog with the draft or, when approved code exists, its line diff against it. Approving makes exactly that draft the approved code and clears the draft; it is refused unless the draft is current and its latest verification passed. **Discard draft** removes the draft and keeps the approved code.

Approved code names the four runs of the verification it was approved on, even once the run history no longer holds them, and its [check version](#check-version). Writes of one journey's code (a save, an approval, a discard or a generated draft) are judged in order as they commit, so a second writer is refused against the first one's code instead of silently overwriting it. Code approved without all four runs, as code was after a single passing run before verification existed, loads as a draft with its code and provenance, and a draft already beside it, being newer, stays instead. Until that draft is verified and approved, a gate settles its journey as `needs_review` without a browser.

The journey card shows the approved code as `Approved` or `Stale`, and the draft as `Draft`, `Verifying n/3`, `Verified`, `Verification failed` with its error, or `Stale draft`, beside `Generating` or `Generation failed` with its error.

### Generating code

**Generate code** writes a reviewed journey's code with existing tools: the Playwright Test generator agent that `playwright init-agents --loop=opencode` emits, run headlessly by [OpenCode](https://opencode.ai) (`opencode-ai@1.18.32`) against OpenRouter. Perpetual writes no agent loop or MCP client (`src/journeys/playwright/generation.ts`). It needs a reviewed case with milestones and independent checks, an OpenRouter model in Settings, and the stage's application URL. An existing application URL needs no twin; a URL belonging to a managed twin must name this stage's ready twin. It holds any such twin like a run, one generation per case at a time, and is refused while a verification runs in the stage; **Stop generating** cancels it. Nothing else starts a generation: not a view, a restart or the gate.

Discovery and drafting name concrete expected inputs, with `{run}` for data each run owns. Whole-value descriptive check placeholders such as `<the unique title entered>` must be corrected before review or code generation; incomplete drafts and historical evidence remain readable, and an unchanged legacy case does not block editing another case. This guard catches that narrow placeholder form, not every ambiguous natural-language expectation. Template syntax such as `{{title}}` is literal content, never a variable the runner resolves. Review still determines whether the checks judge the complete business outcome.

Inside the private workspace, Perpetual replaces the stock generator's ordinary-test instructions with its action-only contract, while retaining Playwright's tools and browser exploration. The generator must distinguish concrete values used while exploring from the `journey.run` expression used in replay, preserve the reviewed fields, and observe navigation and search transitions. Before a milestone or final check can read run-owned data, the grammar requires an earlier typing action using the actual token; typing the literal words `journey.run` cannot satisfy this rule. That check establishes an input exists, not that it was entered into the right field or persisted correctly.

For code generation and its grammar repair, an eligible model whose OpenRouter catalog explicitly lists the `medium` reasoning effort receives `options.reasoning.effort: "medium"` in OpenCode's model configuration. This avoids relying on a provider's disabled-reasoning default. Unsupported, missing or unavailable capability metadata leaves provider defaults unchanged; Perpetual never guesses support from the model's name. Reasoning can consume additional model tokens, while deterministic journey runs still use no model.

Explicitly regenerating a draft whose current verification failed includes its failure reason in the protected plan as untrusted diagnostic data. The feedback must belong to the same reviewed contract, exact draft and current check version; stale evidence is excluded. Credentials and known secret shapes are redacted before the error is bounded to 4,000 characters. Previous code is not sent, because its input literals may contain historical account values. The generator must investigate the actual UI and preserve the reviewed contract. This starts no automatic retry and changes no approval rule. Authoring guidance also requires a stable fresh readback after a save, so a blocked write can reach an independent outcome check instead of timing out waiting for a success redirect.

To synchronize readback with the observed submission response, the action grammar permits one bounded synchronization form: `await Promise.all([page.waitForResponse('observed URL pattern'), one UI action]);`. The response listener is armed first; both the real response and the control's blocked response settle it before a fresh readback. It exposes no response data, callbacks, predicates, variables or arbitrary concurrent actions. A response is readiness evidence only: headers can precede body completion or a queued write. The unchanged reviewed checks judge what the application kept.

When a test account is selected or supplied, the generation first signs in once, as a journey does and on the stage's sign-in page when one is set, through the runtime that runs journeys and with no model. One that cannot sign in fails with *The test account could not sign in:* and the fixture's reason, and one that cannot open the application fails with *The application could not be opened:* and the reason, before the harness starts, so no model call is spent and no draft is written from pages the generator never saw. The generator's read-only plan holds the complete reviewed goal, preconditions, milestones with every check, expected outcomes and final assertions, as well as the grammar's rules and where `journey.run` may replace `{run}`. These expectations guide its actions but never become assertions in generated code. Its instructions require it to report missing prerequisites or observed application failures and stop, rather than substitute recovery controls, earlier entities or guessed remaining actions. These authoring rules do not establish semantic correctness; verification and approval remain required.

The generation works in a private folder that is removed after confirmed cleanup; unconfirmed external browser ownership retains it across restarts. The generator can write only test files in its own `tests/` folder; the config, seed, fixture mapping, plan and OpenCode configuration are read-only and must stay unchanged. OpenCode runs with its own `HOME`, so it reads none of your global OpenCode configuration, plugins or instructions, and only OpenCode receives the model key. Each harness call has 10 minutes.

A terminal generation failure keeps its bounded, redacted reason and any rejected code across controller restarts, beside the existing draft. Restoring that explanation starts no worker or model call and never clears an origin's cleanup hold. A newly admitted generation, a successful code save, or deleting or changing the reviewed journey clears the previous failure. Cancellation leaves no failure unless cleanup itself is unconfirmed. If the failure record cannot be saved, the current view keeps the original reason and reports the storage error; that unsaved explanation cannot be guaranteed after restart.

The written file is validated against the grammar. Invalid output gets one repair attempt with the validation error; a still-invalid file fails the generation and nothing is saved. Grammar repair has its own fixed agent configuration: it can read the existing file and plan, initialize the pinned writer with the seed, and write the corrected test. It has no browser-action tools to repeat the business journey. Seed setup still opens the application and signs in when configured; this is not a new business run. Both agents' instructions and configuration remain protected. If the generator writes no test file, generation stops without another model call: check the application and journey prerequisites before explicitly trying again. Its failure and authoring diagnostics remain beside any existing code after cleanup and restart. Missing output alone does not identify an application blocker or establish a business result. A valid file is saved as the draft with its provenance (harness, generator and model) and still needs verification and approval. The test suite drives the pinned test MCP server with a fake harness (`test/fixtures/fake-opencode.ts`); whether a given model writes good code for a real journey is not covered by it.

### Authoring diagnostics

A journey's **Actions → Authoring diagnostics** reads the current source, stage and case's private authoring history. Each record names the reviewed-case hash, accepted-code hash (when a draft was produced), model and pinned harness/generator versions. Generation and its optional grammar repair each retain controller timestamps, elapsed time, an output digest, output byte count, written-code hash, and allowlisted tool outcomes. A tool error reports only that the harness reported an error; its application cause and any unobserved business action remain unknown. A completed generation produces a **draft**, never a successful replay or approval. The three passing verification runs, caught write-blocked control and explicit approval still apply.

Journey generation opts into OpenCode's JSON stream; twin authoring keeps its existing output mode. The parser follows the pinned [OpenCode 1.18.32 run command](https://github.com/anomalyco/opencode/blob/v1.18.32/packages/opencode/src/cli/cmd/run.ts): completed/error `tool_use` envelopes and `step_finish` metadata. It records only known tool names and outcomes; an unknown name becomes `unknown`. Finish reason and usage describe the last structured step finish, not an inferred process exit cause or a total billing estimate. Missing/unsupported metadata stays unknown, including a process that exits successfully without it. Text, comments and available tools never establish actions or milestone completion.

No prompt, URL, page text, tool argument/result, account value, request/header/body, session id, provider error prose or profile data enters the structured record. String fields pass through shared `hide`/`redact` before projection or clipping. JSON-mode error tails are withheld; recognized structured provider refusals map to fixed guidance. Output hashes combine the separate stdout/stderr SHA-256 digests, independently of stream chunk boundaries. Neither the raw streams nor workspaces are retained for diagnostics.

Bounds are 64 tool outcomes per attempt, two attempts per generation, 64 KiB per JSON line and 1 MiB of stdout examined for structured facts. Oversized lines are discarded and parsing resumes at a newline; reaching the stream or outcome bound marks evidence limited. The shared runner's temporary raw text capture is separately limited to 256 KiB per stream and is withheld on overflow. A projected record is at most 32 KiB. The browser manager keeps the latest three records per case and at most 100 across all sources/stages, for fourteen days. Reads omit expired records; startup and ordinary queued saves prune them. Case deletion removes its history. Records share the existing guarded 16 MiB browser state file (0600) and private directory (0700), atomic writes and save queue.

Evidence is captured before workspace removal for success, failure, cancellation and deadline expiry. The manager records incomplete cleanup separately and releases the owned target after cleanup, before persisting nonessential diagnostics. A failed diagnostics save is reported without claiming it was retained. Reading a record or restarting starts no generation, verification, retry or other paid work. Earlier authoring that had no retained record remains **No authoring record**.

## Verdicts

A journey's process reports facts, never a status: how it stopped (`none`, `deadline` or `action`), its milestone states and check results, and its final assertion results; the controller adds `exception` for a process that failed and blockers for a missing account or service. `journeyResult` in `src/browser/results.ts` is the only verdict, applied once per journey on every path, including a process stopped by its time limit and a journey interrupted by a restart. Precedence, highest first:

1. `failed`: a milestone check failed, a final assertion on the reached end state failed, or the journey stopped on an error.
2. `blocked`: a milestone was blocked or a blocker was reported, such as code that signs in with no account.
3. `needs_review`: the deadline passed, an action could not complete (including a milestone skipped or run out of order, code that differs from its approval, and a journey with no current code), a milestone is incomplete, the final assertions were not evaluated, or the journey has no reviewed check or final assertion at all.
4. `passed`: every milestone completed with its checks, every final assertion was checked and passed, and the journey has at least one check or final assertion.

Final assertions describe the end state, so when a journey stopped short of it (a blocked or failed milestone, a reported blocker, or an early stop) they are shown as not reached and neither fail nor pass the journey. Expected outcomes are backed by the checks alone: `Checks · Failed` only when a final assertion on the reached end state failed, and `Checks · Not reached` when the journey stopped earlier. A run rolls up as `failed`, `blocked`, `needs_review`, `cancelled`, `completed` (the run had skips) or `passed`, in that order. Results of older agent runs still render, without their agent observations.

## Live view and recordings

Beta and Gamma cards list the stage's journeys with their queued, running and result states. Selecting a journey focuses its expanded card in the inspector, which has two views: **Integration tests** and **Runs**. Each running journey streams JPEG frames of its own browser viewport (1280×800), about three per second, and its milestones update with the evidence of their reviewed checks as the controller accepts them. No sample footage or synthetic progress replaces an unavailable stream.

Watching a verification follows it as a whole: when the shown attempt ends, the viewer opens the next one, its control run included, so **Cancel run** stays reachable until the verification settles. An attempt a person opens after it ended stays open, so earlier attempts can be reviewed while the verification runs.

Every tab of a run journey is recorded as WebM; discovery is not recorded. A finished journey plays its recordings (one tab per recording); one without a recording shows its **Last frame**, never presented as live activity. A stage keeps the recordings of its latest 5 runs. A missing recorder leaves a journey unrecorded without failing it; a killed process reports no recording.

Frames and recordings may show test data. They stay behind the local, scoped controller.

### Browser failure diagnostics

To investigate an intermittent browser disconnect, set `PERPETUAL_PLAYWRIGHT_DIAGNOSTICS_DIR` to an absolute local directory before starting the controller or tests. Diagnostics are off by default. An unsuccessful ordinary run retains a bounded lifecycle record after cleanup; successful runs and write-blocked control runs retain none. The record contains page, frame, reload and worker lifecycle facts with local numeric identifiers, without URLs, page contents, request bodies, account values or recordings. Collection and storage failures do not change the journey's verdict or cleanup.

The directory and files are private (0700 and 0600). CI enables this recorder for its Node tests and, only if that test step fails, uploads these lifecycle files with a seven-day retention. No browser profile, application state or recording is uploaded. A diagnostic record helps identify a failure; it does not retry a journey or turn an incomplete run into a pass.

## API

The main routes are below. Every request is scoped to `repoPath` and a Sandbox `stageId`. Mutations need the controller session token and a same-origin request.

| Method and route | Input |
| --- | --- |
| `GET /api/browser` | The stage's configuration, cases, code states, runs and preparation state. |
| `POST /api/browser/config` | `config`: target URL, `signInUrl`, scope, requirements, `maxSteps`, `journeyTimeoutSeconds`, `externalOrigins`, `authEndpoints`, `readOnlyRequests`. |
| `POST /api/browser/cases` | `cases`, `baseCases`; a stale `baseCases` returns 409. |
| `POST /api/browser/draft` | `description`: one draft from a description. |
| `POST /api/browser/transcribe` | A dictated recording. |
| `POST /api/browser/discover` | Starts discovery; optional `replaceCaseIds`, `credentials` or `accountId`. |
| `POST /api/browser/run` | Optional `caseIds`, `concurrency`, `credentials` or `accountId`. |
| `POST /api/browser/skip` | `id`, `caseId` |
| `POST /api/browser/stop` | `id` |
| `GET /api/browser/runs/:id` | Full run progress. |
| `GET /api/browser/runs/:id/frame` | `caseId`: the journey's latest JPEG frame. |
| `GET /api/browser/runs/:id/video` | `caseId`, `file`: a recording the journey reported, with byte ranges. |
| `GET /api/browser/specs/code` | `caseId`: the draft and approved code, for review. |
| `POST /api/browser/specs` | `caseId`, `code`: saves the draft. |
| `POST /api/browser/specs/verify` | `caseId`, `hash`; `POST /api/browser/specs/verify/cancel` with `caseId` stops it. |
| `POST /api/browser/specs/approve` | `caseId`, `hash`: approves the verified draft. |
| `POST /api/browser/specs/discard` | `caseId`, `hash`: removes the draft. |
| `POST /api/browser/specs/reuse` | `caseId`: takes the stale approved code as the draft, when it still fits the journey. |
| `POST /api/browser/specs/generate` | `caseId`; `POST /api/browser/specs/generate/cancel` stops it. |

App-wide model settings are not scoped to a stage: `GET` and `POST /api/settings/model` read and save the OpenRouter model and key, and `GET /api/settings/models` lists the eligible models.

## Implementation

- `src/business/browser-cases.ts`: case validation and redacted, bounded source context.
- `src/browser/`: scoped state, process supervision, scheduling, model settings, frames, recordings, verification and the verdict (`results.ts`).
- `src/journeys/playwright/`: the code grammar, fixture, checks, reporter, runtime and code generation.
- `src/agents/opencode.ts`: the OpenCode harness that code generation and [twin config generation](twins.md#generated-twin-config) share.
- `integrations/browser-use/`: the pinned Python discovery worker (Browser Use and Playwright for Python), its sign-in helper and frames. Its [README](../integrations/browser-use/README.md) documents the worker protocol.
- `client/src/BrowserTestingPanel.tsx`, `BrowserAgentViewer.tsx` and the journey components: the interface.

## Tests

- `npm test` type-checks both TypeScript projects, then covers the controller, case validation, verdicts, scheduling, the code grammar and the API, and runs journey code, verification and its control run in a real Chromium.
- `npm run test:browser` runs the Python discovery worker's tests, including a real Chromium against disposable local pages.
- `node scripts/browser-agent-contract.ts` runs discovery through the real controller, Browser Use and Chromium against a disposable page with a deterministic model fixture, and checks that its drafts need review and that live frames stream.

These use deterministic fixtures. They establish contracts and failure behaviour, not a real model's accuracy on a real application.
