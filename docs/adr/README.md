# Architecture decision records

An architecture decision record (ADR) notes one decision that is hard to reverse, surprising without context, and the result of a real trade-off. A decision that is easy to reverse or follows the obvious path needs no ADR. Vocabulary belongs in the root `CONTEXT.md`, and longer designs in `docs/architecture/`.

## Convention

- One decision per file, numbered in sequence: `0001-slug.md`, `0002-slug.md`. Take the number after the highest existing one, and never reuse a number.
- Title the file with the decision, then write one to three sentences: the context, what was decided, and why.
- Add a **Status** (`proposed`, `accepted`, `deprecated` or `superseded by ADR-NNNN`), **Considered options** or **Consequences** only when they add something a reader needs.
- To change a decision, write a new ADR and mark the old one superseded rather than rewriting it.
